   <p> The restaurant business is considered a prime target for cyber attacks, especially when good practices are not
       implemented within the industry. While assessing different resturants, I discovered significant
       data on the frequency of cyber attacks targeting restaurants and small businesses. These attacks can lead to serious 
       consequences, including substantial financial losses and, in some cases, business failure. </p>
    
    <h2>Potential Cyber Risks:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Point of slae (POS) system vulnerabilities</strong>: 
            <p> - There could be weaknesses in POS systrems, which can lead to attacker
                having access to customer payment infomration and customer data.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Phishing Attacks</strong>:
            <p> - Phishing attacks also happen in resturant businesses. When a resturant is not protected form cyber attacks, 
                these attcks pose significant threats. There are different types of phishing attakcs that cna happento resturants 
                and small businesses.

                    <li>Spear phising</li>
                    <li>Email phishing</li>
                    <li>Business email compromise(BEC)</li>
                    <li>Smishing</li>
                    <li>social media phishing</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Data Breaches:</strong> 
            <p>Many restaurants are experiencing incidents of data breaches, 
               resulting in the exposure of sensitive information belonging to customers and employees.</p>
            <p>This is significant to recognize due to the dangers it poses. Attackers can gain access to personal
               information such as social security numbers, driverâ€™s license numbers, health insurance details, and other credentials. 
               The repercussions extend beyond the targeted individuals, as these breaches can severely impact the business itself.</p></li>
